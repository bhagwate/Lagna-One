        <p>I have been a full time IT and software professional for 14 years and have done Master's in Computer Applications. I am certified corporate IT trainer by Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur, India and IBM Corporation. I have worked with leading IT companies in banking and financial services domain at global cities including London, Singapore, Mumbai, Copenhagen, Hong Kong etc.</p>
        <p>My journey in Jyotish or Vedic astrology as popularly called, numerology and spiritual science began in the year 1999 and I started horoscope analysis in the year 2001. All through that decade, I was pursuing my full time job in the IT along-side astrology as well in parallel.</p>
        <p>In my eventful journey of more than a decade and half as practicing astrologer, I have done consultations for people from different walks of life across various cultures and countries (thanks to the internet).</p>
        <p>In my view, Astrology is all about understanding root cause analysis and karmic healing required to handle/help in major obstacles in life - child birth issues, delayed marriage or serious relationship/marriage issues, career challenges, legal disputes, debts and loans, or other long standing challenges in life.</p>
        <p>If you wish to know more about my astrology journey or want to connect with the astrologer in me, here is my astrology page&#9758;<a href="https://www.AstrologyOfBharat.org"> AstrologyOfBharat.org</a></p>
